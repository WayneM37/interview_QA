Python


Dictionary

- Q: What is a dictionary in Python?
- A: Python dictionary is one of the supported data types in Python. It is an unordered collection of elements. The elements in dictionaries are stored as key–value pairs. Dictionaries ae ndxed by key.For exmple, below we have a disare ict named my_dict. It contains two keys, fruit and vegatable, along with their corresponding values, banana and onion.
- my_dict = {'fruit':'banana', 'vegatable':'onion'}


SET

Q: Which one of the following is not the correct syntax for creating a set in Python?

A:

a. set([[1,2],[3,4],[4,5]])

b. set([1,2,2,3,4,5])

c. {1,2,3,4}

d. set((1,2,3,4))


Explanation: The iterable argument given for the set must be used in a correct way.

SQL

- Q: What is a Database?
- A: A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. In simple terms, a database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. When you order a product on a commercial website, your order is stored in a database. You withdrew money from your bank account. Your bank stores this transaction in the database. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter use databases to store data like members, their friends, member activities, messages, advertisements, etc.
- Interview Q&A

- Q: What is a table, column and row?
- A: A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of columns and rows. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.
- Interview Q&A

- Q: What is SQL?
- A: SQL stands for Structured Query Language and used to communicate with a database. With SQL, you can access or manipulate data stored in the database.

- Q: What are some common clauses used with SELECT query in SQL?
- A: WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, GROUP BY clause and HAVING clause

Q: What is an aggregate function?
A: An aggregate function performs operations on a collection of values to return a single scalar value. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses of the SELECT statement.

- Q: What is a Join?
- A: The SQL Join clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a SQL database based on a related column between the two.
- 
- Q: What is inner join?
- A: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used join for queries.

- What is a Subquery?
- A: A subquery is a query within another query, also known as nested query or inner query . It is used to restrict or enhance the data to be queried by the main query, thus restricting or enhancing the output of the main query respectively.

Q: What are Constraints in SQL?

A: NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column. DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field. UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field. PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table. FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.

Q: What is a Primary Key?

A: The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.

Loops

Q: What are the two major loop statements?
A: for and while loops.

- Q: How does for loop and while loop differ in Python and when do you choose to use them?
- A: For loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as list, tuple, set and dictionary.
- While loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. This is how Python differs in handling loops from the other programming languages.

- Q: What are Python iterators?
- A: Iterators in Python are array-like objects which allow moving on the next element. We use them in traversing a loop, for example, in aforloop.

- Q: How does for loop and while loop differ in Python and when do you choose to use them?
- A: For loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as list, tuple, set and dictionary.
- While loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. This is how Python differs in handling loops from the other programming languages.


Functions


- Q: What is function in Python?
- A: A function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called. To define a Python function, the def keyword is used.

- Q: Explain Python functions.
- A: A function is a section of the program or a block of code that is written once and can be executed whenever required in the program. A function is a block of self-contained statements which has a valid name, parameters list, and body. Functions make programming more functional and modular to perform modular tasks. Python provides several built-in functions to complete tasks and also allows a user to create new functions as well. There are two types of functions: Built-In Functions:copy(),len(),count()are the some built-in functions. User-defined Functions: Functions which are defined by a user known as user-defined functions.

- Q: How do we write a function in Python?
- A: We can create a Python function in the following manner. Step-1: to begin the function, start writing with the keyword def and then mention the function name. Step-2: We can now pass the arguments and enclose them using the parentheses. A colon, in the end, marks the end of the function header.
  Step-3: After pressing an enter, we can add the desired Python statements for execution. 

- Q: What is the return keyword used for in Python?
- A: The purpose of a function is to receive the inputs and return some output. The return is a Python statement which we can use in a function for sending a value back to its caller. 

- Q: What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it?
- A: We use *args when we aren’t sure how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if we want to pass a stored list or tuple of arguments to a function. **kwargs is used when we don’t know how many keyword arguments will be passed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The identifiers args and kwargs are a convention, you could also use *bob and **billy but that would not be wise.

- Q: What is the namespace in Python?
- A: The namespace is a fundamental idea to structure and organize the code that is more useful in large projects. A namespace is defined as a simple system to control the names in a program. It ensures that names are unique and won't lead to any conflict. Also, Python implements namespaces in the form of dictionaries and maintains name-to-object mapping where names act as keys and the objects as values. 

- Q: What are local variables and global variables in Python?
- A: Variables declared outside a function or in global space are called global variables. These variables can be accessed by any function in the program. Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable. This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space. When you try to access the local variable outside the function, it will give an error.

- Q: What is a lambda function?
- A: A lambda function is an anonymous function (a function that does not have a name) in Python. To define anonymous functions, we use the ‘lambda’ keyword instead of the ‘def’ keyword, hence the name ‘lambda function’. Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one statement.
- 
- Q: What Are The Principal Differences Between The Lambda And Def?
- A:
- - Def can hold multiple expressions while lambda is a uni-expression function.
- - Def generates a function and designates a name to call it later. Lambda forms a function        object and returns it.
- - Def can have a return statement. Lambda can’t have return statements. 
- - Lambda supports to get used inside a list and dictionary.

- Q: What is map function in Python?
- A: map function executes the function given as the first argument on all the elements of the iterable given as the second argument. If the function given takes in more than 1 arguments, then many iterables are given. 

- Q: How to import modules in Python?
- A: Modules can be imported using the import keyword. You can import modules in three ways. Example:

- Q: What are python modules? Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python.
- A: Python modules are files containing Python code. This code can either be functions classes or variables. A Python module is a .py file containing executable code. Some of the commonly used built-in modules are: os, sys, math, random, datetime. 

- Q: How can you generate random numbers in Python?
- A: Random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random number. The method is defined as:
- 

Modules

- Q: What is module and package in Python?
- A: In Python, module is the way to structure the program. Each Python program file is a module, which imports other modules like objects and attributes. The folder of Python program is a package of modules. A package can have modules or subfolders.


Errors


- Q: What are the Errors and Exceptions in Python? A:
In Python, there are two types of errors: syntax error and exceptions.
- Syntax Error: It is also known as parsing errors. Errors are issues in a program which may cause it to exit abnormally. When an error is detected, the parser repeats the offending line and then displays an arrow which points at the earliest point in the line.
- Exceptions: Exceptions take place in a program when the normal flow of the program is interrupted due to the occurrence of an external event. Even if the syntax of the program is correct, there are chances of detecting an error during execution, this error is nothing but an exception. Some of the examples of exceptions are - ZeroDivisionError, TypeError and NameError.

- Q: Give some examples of standard errors that occour in Python.A:

- TypeError- It occurs when the expected type does not match with the given type of a variable.
- ValueError- It occurs when an expected value is not given, suppose you are expecting 6 elements in a list and you gave 2.
- NameError- It occurs when you are trying to access an undefined variable or a function.
- IOError- It occurs when you are trying to access a file that does not exist.
- IndexError- It occurs when you are trying to access an invalid index of a sequence.
- KeyError- It occurs when you use an invalid key to access a value in the dictionary.







AGILE


Q: Do you know about Agile Manifesto & its Principles? Explain in brief.

A: There are four values in the manifesto. Individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to the changes are the values. Stemming from these values there are 12 principles in agile. These principles can be summarized as to satisfy the customer, to welcome changing requirements, good cooperation between business people and developers (working together), face to face conversation, motivated individuals and simplicity.


Q: What is the duration of a scrum sprint?
A: It depends on the number of people in the development team and the size of the project. In general, a scrum sprint is completed in 1-4 weeks.

Q: What is the role of the Scrum Master?
A: Scrum Master coaches the team, protects the team from organizational distraction, clears any obstacles encountered and helps team members focus on what they do. Scrum Master ensures that scrum is understood well by the team members and it is working properly. Scrum Master constantly improves the team's environment. While the product owner has a directing role, Scrum Master has an enabling role in a scrum team.


Q: Explain what is Kanban.
A: A Kanban is like a flash card carrying all the information about the current status of your work and the work required to be done on the product at each stage of the software development process.

Q: Describe the places where ‘Scrum' and ‘Kanban' are used?
A: Scrum is a better choice when you need a more prominent process. However, if you want improvement in running the process without much changes in the whole scenario, you should use Kanban.

Q: Which hosting options are available for Jira Software?
A: There are three hosting options available: Atlassian Cloud, Server, and Data Center (Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure).

Q: What is project key in Jira Software?
A: A project key is a unique code for your project. Jira Software will automatically generate a short project key in accordance with your project name. However, if you want to specify this auto-generated key yourself, you can change it.


Network


- Q: What is a Computer Network?
- A: A computer network is a connection network between two or more nodes usingPhysical MediaLinks viz., cable, or wireless to exchange data over pre-configured services and Protocols. A computer network is a collective result of – Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Telecommunication, Computer Engineering, and Information Technology involving their theoretical as well as practical aspects into action. The most widely used Computer Network of Today is the Internet which supports the World Wide Web (WWW).

- Q: Explain at s LAN?
- A: A LAN or Loal Area Networkwich is the network between devices that are located within a small physical location. It can be either wireless or wired. One LAN differs from another based on the following factors:
- Topology: The arrangement of nodes within the network
- Protocol: Refer to the rules for the transfer of data
- Media: These devices can be connected using optic fibers, twisted-pair wires, etc.


- Q: What do you mean by a Node?
- A: The intersection point in a network is called a Node. Nodes can send or receive data/ information within a network. For example, if two computers are connected to form a network, there are 2 nodes in that network. Similarly, in the case of adding more computers, there will be more nodes and so on. It is not necessary for a node to be a computer, it can be any communication device such as a printer, servers, modems, etc..


- Q: What is WAN?
- A: WAN stands for Wide Area Network. It is an interconnection of computers and devices that are geographically dispersed. It connects networks that are located in different regions and countries

- Q: What do you mean by network topology?
- A: Network topology specifies the layout of a computer network. It shows how devices and cables are connected to each other. Some types of topologies are: Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, etc.

- Q: Describe star topology
- A: Star topology consists of a central hub that connects the nodes. This is one of the easiest way to setup and maintain.


- Q: What is the disadvantage of a star topology?
- A: One major disadvantage of star topology is that once the central hub or switch damaged, the entire network becomes unusable

- Q: What are some drawbacks of implementing a ring topology?
- A: In case one workstation on the network suffers a malfunction, it can bring down the entire network. Another drawback is that when there are adjustments and reconfigurations needed to be performed on a particular part of the network, the entire network has to be temporarily brought down as well.

- Q: What is mesh topology?
- A: Mesh topology is a setup wherein each device is connected directly to every other device on the network. Consequently, it requires that each device has at least two network connections

- Q: What is one advantage of mesh topology?
- A: In the event that one link fails, there will always be another available. Mesh topology is actually one of the most fault-tolerant network topology.

QUESTION - 7 : Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.

Sample answer  - 1 By Linda Raynier CPA, CA, Career StrategistI was asked to work on a high-profile project that included collaborating with a new team and tons of people across a larger organization.We were spread out across the globe, which meant timezones were tricky and we could never meet face-to-face. Communication was starting to get confusing, and people were losing important details.It became apparent that this project was going to fail if we didn’t have a new strategy, so I met with various team members and engaged them in a process where we designed and implemented a communication system that would work a lot better.We then did weekly check-ins; designed a protocol to share relevant updates so we’d stay on track; developed a detailed outline of goals and milestones; and led the meetings.In the end, the team made massive progress. We completed the project on time, and it was praised extensively by the client. The team thanked me for helping to course-correct. We also continue to use these tools, and they are what make our team so much more efficient at what we do.Why this answer worked well:

- She described the positive results and teamwork skills she demonstrated along the way.

Sample answer  - 2 By Program Manager ProfessionalWhile working for a major airline, I was on a team that was tasked to jointly determine the growth plans for a joint venture we operated in partnership with two other airlines. Naturally, the team was made up of individuals based around the world, each with very different views on the economic and competitive landscape. At first, our plans clashed significantly.One challenge we were trying to solve in our term sheet was how to adjust our plans during times of economic uncertainty. Each team had a different idea for what actions to take, and when. To help reach alignment I proposed that we look at real historic examples of economic downturns, bankruptcies, volcanic eruptions, and similar events — and use them as case examples to set a range of appropriate reactions. Then, we’d tie these reactions to indicators, such as global passenger volume, GDP growth, and stock market indicators — all universally understood and applicable.Once we established this framework for using hard data to guide acceptable strategic actions, the team was able to collaborate with more trust and a common language. Our analysis was unified and based on the same inputs, and this allowed us to quickly and successfully align on a term sheet for the joint venture.

Why this answer worked well:
- The candidate showcased their ability to align stakeholders with very divergent points of view.
- The answer included strategic thinking skills and personal initiative.

Sample answer  - 3 By Product Manager ProfessionalI joined a team 6 months after the MVP launch which was moderately successful, but short of management expectations. Without a real roadmap, the team was just running small experiments to drive incremental gains.I quickly realized that we’d need to do more than that to realize the long-term vision of the product. To gain the trust of my new team, I focused on what could be improved in the immediate future. I helped rationalize the short-term experiment roadmap, organized execution, removed roadblocks, and helped ship few of the high potential experiments.Concurrently, I spent time with the executive team to understand their expectations. After observing users and analyzing our logs, I partnered with team leads across Engineering, Design, and Research to develop an updated mission statement and a set of defined success metrics.Within 3 months, we were charging full-speed ahead with an updated roadmap, improvement operational metrics, and significant boost on a platform satisfaction survey. Two years later, the product had been used by hundreds of millions of people every month — 40 times the amount we started with.Why this answer worked well:
- The candidate demonstrated their ability to identify areas of opportunity, backed up by quantifiable results.
- The answer included important soft skills like collaboration and team-building.
